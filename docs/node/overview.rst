Node.js Overview
================

Use this space to describe the applications located under ``apps/``: build
requirements, runtime architecture, API boundaries, and integration notes. As
more Node.js documentation is written, add the new files to
``docs/node/index.rst`` so they are shown in the navigation tree.

Firmware Overview
=================

This is the holding page for firmware documentation. Add board-specific setup
steps, bootloader notes, and API docs for the code in ``fw/`` here. When you
create additional firmware documents, list them in ``docs/firmware/index.rst``
so they appear in the navigation sidebar.
